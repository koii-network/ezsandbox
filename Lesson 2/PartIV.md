# Lesson 2: Networking and Storage Task

## Part IV: Deploying Locally

You've successfully written your own networking task, now it's time to test it locally!

Prerequisites:

- Completed upnp-basics template
- Basic understanding of Docker
- Koii CLI installed
- Docker and Docker Compose installed

Testing tasks locally through Docker is a process that requires a little set up. Essentially, we have to create a local version of the backend that's used to verify a task's work, which is known as K2. After creating our local K2, we'll deploy the task there for testing!

## Environment Setup

1. Before starting, please ensure your Koii Node app is **NOT** running! To get a local instance of K2, run `koii-test-validator` and leave the terminal running. This will serve as the backend you deploy the task to.

2. Next, we should set your Koii CLI to deploy tasks locally. We can do this using:

```bash
koii config set --url http://127.0.0.1:8899
```

Verify you're using the correct settings with `koii config get`, which should show something like this:

```bash
Config File: C:\Users\test\.config\koii\cli\config.yml
RPC URL: http://127.0.0.1:8899
WebSocket URL: ws://127.0.0.1:8900/ (computed)
Keypair Path: ~/.config/koii/id.json
Commitment: confirmed
```

3. With the backend taken care of, lets make sure our task wants to deploy to the right environment. Within `env.local`, ensure you change `K2_NODE_URL` to point to the right endpoint:

```javascript
K2_NODE_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:8899"; // Linux

K2_NODE_URL = "http://host.docker.internal:8899"; // Windows & Mac
```

4. With that setup, we can deploy the task using `npx @_koii/create-task-cli@latest`. If you forgot how, [click here!](https://docs.koii.network/develop/command-line-tool/create-task-cli/create-task)

**NOTE**: This is a local environment that doesn't reflect your actual wallet, so there's no need to worry about cost. In fact, if you use the command `koii airdrop 10000` you can give yourself plenty of tokens to test with!

5. Now that your task is live, note down the task ID and the executable CID. When you deployed your task, some `TASK DATA` was logged to the console. Look for `task_audit_program_id`; this is your executable CID. Place your taskID in your `.env.local` as shown below:

```dotenv
TASKS="ETHVehVJbepd4RZjUqoR2iveYTAsauLpd4kiCRnPUE7Y" //Your task's ID
```

6. If you've previously deployed your task, you'll need to navigate to the `dist` folder and rename `main.js` to `<YOUR CID>.js`, using the executable CID you just saved.

## Using Docker

Once the task is deployed, we can finally use Docker! Navigate to `docker-compose.yaml` and verify that `~/.config/koii:/app/config` accurately represents your wallet location.

Finally, in a separate terminal from the one running `koii-test-validator`, run `docker compose up` and you'll have a Dockerized instance of your task spun up.

This terminal will now showcase all the logs in real time that you could expect from deploying your task live on the Node. You can observe rounds, submissions, errors, warnings, or anything else you find interesting.

If you ran into any issues or want to understand this topic more in depth, learn more about Dockerized Tasks [here](https://docs.koii.network/develop/write-a-koii-task/task-development-kit-tdk/test/docker-test).

You've reached the end of this lesson which means you're now familiar with building tasks that can network. Additionally, you now know how to test them locally with Docker! The next lesson will introduce using secrets and building our very own web crawler.

Next up, we'll take a look at secrets and the config options in [Lesson 3](../Lesson%203/README.md).
