## 🌐 Overview

EZSandbox is a comprehensive, hands-on tutorial series designed to teach developers how to build decentralized applications (dApps) using the Koii Network. This tutorial takes you from beginner to advanced, providing a step-by-step journey into community-hosted computing.

### 🎯 Tutorial Goals
- Learn to develop and deploy decentralized tasks
- Understand distributed computing principles
- Build scalable, community-powered applications

### 🚀 Key Technologies & Concepts
- Node.js
- Decentralized computing
- Task deployment
- Networking and storage
- Security and authentication
- Custom token creation
- Task node operations

## 📋 Prerequisites

To get the most out of this tutorial, you should have:
- Basic JavaScript/Node.js knowledge
- Familiarity with command-line interfaces
- A computer with:
  - Node.js (v14+ recommended)
  - Git
  - Docker (optional, but recommended for some lessons)
