# Welcome to EZSandbox

In this series of workshops, we'll get you up and running to build your first community-hosted application in no time.

This sandbox will take you through a few phases of development to try using Koii Tasks at all levels.

1. Deploy Locally on your Koii Task Node to Debug and Iterate Rapidly

2. Deploy to Docker to test audits and incentive mechanisms

3. Launch on the Community Cloud

# Lessons and Code Samples

In this project, we'll start by demonstrating the key features of the Node compute environment. After some local testing, we'll harden our incentive mechanism and deploy it to the Koii cloud.

Koii is a network of people, using their nodes to support a diverse ecosystem of products and services, all operated by community members like you.

Decentralized Applications on the Koii Cloud run in modules called 'Tasks' and anyone can join by running a Koii Node, a program users install which manages and runs Tasks.

At the end of these tutorials, you'll be ready to build your first Koii Application that other community members can then run on their Node.

## Lesson 0: Quick Start Guide

Want to skip the explanations and get started quickly? Get a task up and running in 5 minutes.

## Lesson 1: Introduction to Koii Tasks

In the first lesson, we'll set up a Koii Node and start debugging an existing Task.

This lesson will teach you:

- How to debug tasks live with your Node
- How Tasks run in the node
- How to connect to your node

## Lesson 2: Networking and Storage Task

Once we've got the basics down, we can move on to writing a task of our own. We'll learn how to use networking and storage with the example of a simple file server. We'll also see how to deploy our app on a Dockerized node and test it out locally.

<br />
<br />

## Lesson 3: Secrets & Config

One of the best use cases for Koii nodes is to gather data from the web. In this tutorial, we'll show you how to use local secrets on your node, take a closer look at the config options, and learn how to build out a full web crawler that runs on any participating Task Nodes.

![Auditing & Distribution](https://github.com/koii-network/ezsandbox/assets/113378734/d9ecac0d-7c89-4f8e-8038-5f0d77425c63)

<br />
<br />

## Lesson 4: Auditing & Distribution

We can now start to add audit and distribution mechanisms, learning more about how to verify work and define incentives. We'll also learn how data can be shared between nodes by looking at an example.

## Lesson 5: Security & Hardening

Now that you've seen several different types of tasks, this lesson will cover how to add authorized accounts, verify signatures, and manage general authentication and data authority issues.

## Lesson 6: Using Custom Tokens for Tasks

This lesson will teach you how to deploy your own custom KPL token on Koii.

## Lesson 7: Deploying your Task

Once everything is tightened down, it's time to get your community and start running nodes. We'll get you a small grant in KOII to fund your task bounty, deploy the task, and run it on your node.

## Lesson 8: Performance Improvements

After your task is live, it's time to consider improving your work. In this final lesson, we'll cover some tips on debugging, multi-node simulations, and how to publish an update to your Task.
