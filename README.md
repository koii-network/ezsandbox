# Welcome to EZSandbox

In this series of workshops, we'll get you up and running to build your first community-hosted application in no time.

This sandbox will take you through a few phases of development to try using Koii Tasks at all levels.

1. Deploy Locally on your Koii Task Node to Debug and Iterate Rapidly

2. Deploy to Docker to test audits and incentive mechanisms

3. Launch on the Community Cloud

# Lessons and Code Samples

In this project, we'll start by demonstrating the key features of the Node compute environment. After some local testing, we'll harden our incentive mechanism and deploy it to the Koii cloud.

Koii is a network of people, using their nodes to support a diverse ecosystem of products and services, all operated by community members like you.

Decentralized Applications on the Koii Cloud run in modules called 'Tasks' and anyone can join by installing a Koii Node. You can think of a Koii Node as a Tool, sort of like a document-editor or web browser which reads and operates Tasks instead of documents or web pages.

At the end of these tutorials, you'll be ready to build your first Koii Application that other community members can then run on their Node.

## Lesson 1: Your Node

In the first lesson, we'll set up a Koii Node and start debugging an existing Task.

This lesson will teach you:

- How to debug tasks live with your Node
- How Tasks run in the node
- How to connect to your node
- How to build your Task Module and ship it for production

[Start Here](./Lesson%201/README.md)

## Lesson 2: Networking & Storage

Once we've got the basics down, we can move on to some standard use cases for decentralized applications.

To get started, we'll build out a simple file server and add some HTTP server endpoints. Once that's online, we will deploy our app onto a group of nodes with docker, and have them send a file around to eachother.

## Lesson 3: Crawlers and Secrets

One of the best use cases for Koii nodes is to gather data from the web. In this tutorial, we'll show you how to use local secrets on your node, and how to build out a full web crawler that runs on any participating Task Nodes.

## Lesson 4: Data Sharing & Replication Incentives

With this step online, we can now start to add audit mechanisms and incentives.

Audits keep things secure, allowing nodes to verify eachother's work.

Incentives allow the Task to make payments, either in KOII, USDC, or another token (your own, if you dare!) and reward nodes that pass audits.

## Lesson 5: Security and Hardening

with the basics implemented, this lesson will cover how to add authorized accounts, verify signatures, and manage general authentication and data authority issues.

## Lesson 6: Using Custom Tokens for Tasks

This lesson will teach you how to deploy your own custom SPL token on Koii.

Start Here (coming soon)

## Lesson 7: Getting faucet tokens and deploying your task

Once everything is tightened down, it's time to get your community and start running nodes. We'll get you a small grant in KOII to fund your task bounty, deploy the task, and run it on your node.

Start Here (Coming Soon)

## Lesson 8: Performance Improvements & Iteration Lifecycle

After your task is live, it's time to consider improving your work.

In this final lesson, we'll cover some tips on debugging, multi-node simulations, and how to publish an update to your Task.
