# KPL Tokens Quick Reference

## Creating KPL Tokens

Visit [this site](https://dev-blue-spl-token-creator.vercel.app/) to create a KPL token.

You will be asked to enter the following information:

1. **Wallet.json**
   If you have deployed your own tasks in previous lessons, you should already know how to obtain your `wallet.json`.

> [!NOTE]
>
> `Wallet.json` is handled through the front-end JavaScript, so rest assured, your `wallet.json` file will never be uploaded anywhere and will always remain on your local machine.
>

2. **PNG/ICO/JPEG**
   This is your icon. It is best if it is square; otherwise, it may be cropped.

3. **Token Name/Token Symbol/Token Description**
   These are the details of your token. The symbol represents the unit, such as FIRE and KOII.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Please remember your token's Token Public Key, as it will be needed in the next step for minting.

## Minting Tokens

Enter the amount of tokens you'd like to mint, your `wallet.json` file, and your Token Public Key.

## Checking Token Balance

You can check the token balance by choosing "Connect Finnie" to link your [Finnie Wallet](https://docs.koii.network/concepts/finnie-wallet/introduction), and then clicking "Fetch Tokens".
